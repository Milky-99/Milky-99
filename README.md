As a Syrian physician, my heart aches with a deep desire to once again serve those in need. 
The years spent in Lebanon, facing hardship after hardship, were incredibly difficult. However, I stand here now, incredibly grateful for the opportunity to rebuild my life in the US while pursuing further studies.

Understanding the need to balance my studies with the financial realities of starting anew, I'm open to exploring various opportunities. 


Thank you for taking the time to learn about my story. 

Together, we can build a brighter future.
